> note: [WireViz](https://github.com/wireviz/WireViz) is a good tool to document
connectors and wire harnesses

## Errata / Wishlist 
Known issues, limitations, errors and their workarounds. This is also a good place
to drop notes on what should be done in the next revision. 

## Additional notes on how to use this template
* Create your kicad project, shcematics and pcb files in this repository
* Gerber files and BOM go into the Production folder 
* Images, text and design notes go into the Documentation folder 
* Datasheets and application notes go into the Datasheets folder
* Make a new release tag for every manufactured revision of the board, work on a
separate branch for new revisions
* Optinally: you can keep track of testing notes and results in a new Testing folder
